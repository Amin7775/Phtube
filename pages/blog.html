                <div class="text-xl">

                    <p class="">In programming, scope is an area where variables stay. It defines where a variable can
                        work or not.Their are 2 types of scope. Global and Local.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Var, let and const are 3 different types of variable declaration methods.They have their own
                        scopes. among those 3, let and const are more similar to each other and more powerful than var.
                        they are also preferred more than var</p>

                        <p class="flex-wrap">Var is a old declaration type of js which was used before es6 . <br><br>
                            The variables which are declared using var can be used anywhere within the function. it
                            means that if there is any function inside that another function and var is declared on the
                            inside function , we can still use it on the outer function</p>

                    <p class="flex-wrap">Let and Const are new types of variable declarations. They were introduced in
                        the ES6 Js update in 2015.<br><br>
                        let and const are the block type scopes. They are only access-able when they are used inside the
                        function they are declares. <br>
                        For example, If they were declared inside a function and their is another function outside ,
                        they cannot be used on the outside function. As a result they are more secure to use. Because of
                        this feature, let and const is more preferred than the var .

                            2. To check if any value exists inside the object or variable.
